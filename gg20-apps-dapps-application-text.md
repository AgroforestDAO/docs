We have issued Hypercerts to the participants of the initial planting of our pilot agroforest and created an NFT collection showing the baby trees growing in order to allow anyone to get linked to our
Food Forest by supporting the annual management costs of successional nests, where the production of banana supports the growth of different fruit and wood trees. 

All the people (addresses) involved in this process (namely seed providers, volunteers, local team multisig, AgroforestDAO multisig, previous NFT and artists) are included in a split.xyz contract,
and they are rewarded after every sale.ðŸŒ±

Right now we are testing this split framework and it is being done manually after every sale. If you have ideas on how to track the lineage of seeds and seedlings over time in a fractal pattern
please get in touch and let's talk about it.
